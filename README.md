# Unity-Introduction-to-Audio
Made a project to try out the audio features of Unity\
I've added only the Assets folder which contains the scripts, audio files, the scene and the components within it.\
The project contains a structure in which the user can roam around in first person.\
There's a sound of a car going forward from the left side of the user from their starting point and bird's chirping sound behind them going towards right.
